What Is the Difference Between PLAS and Direct Connect?
=======================================================

Direct Connect is a network service on Open Telekom Cloud providing the access interface to private networks within your VPC. Direct Connect connects your VPC to the internal PLAS interface. PLAS works like a broker between any external physical network and the virtual internal networks. You always need to deploy your virtual instances via Direct Connect and the corresponding PLAS ports using either the dialog in the portal or an API.
