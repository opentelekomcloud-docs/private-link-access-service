How Can I Get PLAS?
===================

You will find PLAS in the Open Telekom Cloud portal under "network." To order the service, you need to complete the template with all necessary information on your network connection. In some cases without automation, you need to add an Excel sheet with additional information for the PLAS administrator. We also offer some non-standard options, in this case please get in touch with sales or send a ticket to our service desk.
