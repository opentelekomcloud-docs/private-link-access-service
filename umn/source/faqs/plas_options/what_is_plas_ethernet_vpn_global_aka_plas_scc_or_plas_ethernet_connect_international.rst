What Is PLAS Ethernet VPN Global? (aka PLAS SCC or PLAS Ethernet Connect International)
=======================================================================================

PLAS Ethernet VPN Global connects international Ethernet VPNs running different variants of MEF Ethernet standards.

Open Telekom Cloud is connected to Telekom's Secure Cloud Connect product, which is a global Ethernet VPN platform.

Our Open Telekom Cloud data centers in Biere and Magdeburg are redundantly connected to this platform. Using tagged VLAN protocol, Telekom provides different customers with possible traffic separation per customer as virtual links.

You can choose this option via the portal and establish Direct Connect and PLAS instances.

Please note that the initial set-up of your own data center or subsidiary to the SCC platform using local loops might take several weeks. In this case, we recommend waiting until you receive the LOA (Letter of Authorization) specifying the date of readiness.

For more information on Secure Cloud Connect, see chapter "Network products that can be used to connect to Open Telekom Cloud" or see the Network section on the Deutsche Telekom website for "`Gesch√§ftskunden <https://globalcarrier.telekom.com/business-areas/access-transport/ethernet/secure-cloud-connect>`__".
