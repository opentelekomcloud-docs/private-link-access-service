What Is PLAS MPLS? (aka PLAS VPN)
=================================

PLAS MPLS is the connector to provide MPLS-based managed networks access to the Open Telekom Cloud. PLAS and the provider platform are connected between the provider's MPLS-POP (CE) and the PLAS router ports. They use API procedures to connect the network.

Currently, IntraSelect, the managed MPLS network of Deutsche Telekom, is the only MPLS network connected. Using the IntraSelect Cloud Connect product, you can easily establish a connection to Open Telekom Cloud. The architecture is redundant, which means that Open Telekom Cloud and IntraSelect run redundant links and offer active/passive redundancy.

Other MPLS providers are welcome, but they need to create redundant access from their platforms to Open Telekom Cloud data centers. In addition, they need to use Open Telekom Cloud API sets to connect customers.

For more information on IntraSelect, see chapter "Network products that can be used to connect to Open Telekom Cloud" or see the Network section on the Deutsche Telekom website for "`Gesch√§ftskunden <https://geschaeftskunden.telekom.de/vernetzung-digitalisierung/vernetzung/standortvernetzung>`__".
