I Need a Full 10G Link from my Data Center to Open Telekom Cloud. How Can I Do This?
====================================================================================

We have several options for you in this case. These options are not displayed by default, but available in the project mode.

Guidelines:

-  You will use a dedicated PLAS port.
-  You always need full redundancy as active/passive mode in two AZ in two data centers.
-  When working with a third-party network provider, you should establish a project management system to coordinate all steps with all parties involved to get access to Open Telekom Cloud

For Region 1, we typically work with Telekom and you can book the products Lambda Connect or Ethernet Connect. You need to check whether Ethernet Connect 2.0 is available in the data centers and with which option it can be built.

If you work with a third-party provider, they will need a subcontractor for the last mile to the data centers. This should be Telekom Wholesale for link and customer-switch of Lambda Connect.
