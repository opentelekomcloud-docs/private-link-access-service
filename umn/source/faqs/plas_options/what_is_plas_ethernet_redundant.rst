What Is PLAS Ethernet Redundant?
================================

PLAS is the network access service for any kind of external private network, connecting customers to the Open Telekom Cloud. PLAS uses different connectors to connect network products. PLAS Ethernet Redundant is the connector used to obtain access via two links of a layer 2 P2P product terminating on a hub in the German Open Telekom Cloud data centers in Biere and Magdeburg.

The only product currently available is Ethernet Connect in a special variant of the base product. Deutsche Telekom has built aggregation hubs in the network rooms of the data centers that are connected to Open Telekom Cloud.

If the customer orders this product, only a new connection to their local service point has to be established, while the B-end in the data center as well as connectivity to Open Telekom Cloud is prepared. It will be initialized as soon as the customer starts the Direct Connect / PLAS service and is functional when the Ethernet Connect product is ready to use.

Ethernet Connect only establishes a layer 2 connection between the customer's VPC and the customer's location. This means that the layer 3 connection (IP) has to be established additionally by the customer.

For more information on Ethernet Connect, see chapter "Network products that can be used to connect to Open Telekom Cloud" or see the Network section on the Deutsche Telekom website for "`Gesch√§ftskunden <https://geschaeftskunden.telekom.de/vernetzung-digitalisierung/vernetzung/standortvernetzung>`__".
