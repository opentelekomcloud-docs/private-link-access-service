What Bandwidths Are Available to Order?
=======================================

Every PLAS option offers different bandwidths.

You will find the current options when creating Direct Connect and PLAS.

The steps are performed together with our network provider partners, which means that you usually should have the same parameters (see in the category "Architectural Details": "Does the external network bandwidth have to be identical to the Direct Connect and PLAS bandwidth?").

The highest volume for all shared services is 1 Gbit/s. For 10 Gbit/s bandwidth, you need dedicated PLAS ports as described.
