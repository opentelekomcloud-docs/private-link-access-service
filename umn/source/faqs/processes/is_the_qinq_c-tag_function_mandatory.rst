Is the QinQ C-Tag Function Mandatory?
=====================================

You can use C-Tags to separate your traffic. It is mandatory for most Ethernet-based options and IntraSelect.

In some PLAS options that are accessed via a network platform (like Secure Cloud Connect or similar), the S-Tag is used by the platform and the C-Tag can be set by the customer.

When using dedicated PLAS ports for 10G access, this is not mandatory, but optional.
