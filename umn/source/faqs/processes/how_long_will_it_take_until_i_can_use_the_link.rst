How Long Will It Take Until I Can Use the Link?
===============================================

The setup of Direct Connect and PLAS only takes a few minutes when deployed automatically, or a few days when deployed manually.

Since all network products are different, the process will never look the same.

If you already use Equinix Cloud Exchange, this solution will be ready to use in next to no time. No matter whether you start in Frankfurt or at other European Equinix sites, all in all it will only take a few days to deploy a virtual link to Open Telekom Cloud. If you need initial access to the platform from a colocation cage or wish to establish a WAN link, this will take much longer.

IntraSelect as a managed MPLS service is your best choice if you are already using this network and only want to extend it by access to Open Telekom Cloud. This is mainly API-driven, but good preparation is required for the deployment. In summary, it will take two to four weeks to get ready.

The first setup of the Secure Cloud Connect service takes a little longer because you need to connect your location to the platform by means of local loops. This will usually take 8-15 weeks. For extensions with new virtual circuits to Open Telekom Cloud, you can expect about 3 weeks to get ready.

Any point-to-point layer 2 or DWDM link will take a few weeks to establish.

Third-party network providers use subcontractors to access Open Telekom Cloud. This will not be quicker.

In any case, if you expect that getting the external network ready for use will take a long time, you should not start with the creation of Direct Connect and PLAS. Hourly costs are incurred for the Direct Connect and PLAS services, even if you are not actually using them because there is no external network. You should only start configuring the interfaces on Open Telekom Cloud after your provider has informed you about the finalization of your network.
