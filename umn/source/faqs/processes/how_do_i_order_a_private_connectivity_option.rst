How Do I Order a Private Connectivity Option?
=============================================

Start with choosing a network connector on the Open Telekom Cloud portal and follow the dialog to establish the logical links for "Direct Connect" and "PLAS." Please note that you need to prepare a second VPC for redundancy, subnets and virtual gateways with IP addresses. You need these parameters for the dialog.

After successfully establishing the link for PLAS VPN and PLAS Cloud Exchange, you will receive an ID. This ID is needed as a token for your chosen network provider or exchange platform to connect the network to your Open Telekom Cloud tenant.

Please bear in mind that at this stage, you only have a contract with Open Telekom Cloud. In any case, you need a contract for the deployment of the chosen network. You will get this from your sales channel through which you typically handle network contracts. The deployment by the network provider may take at least two weeks for contracts involving an IP MPLS VPN or more than 6 weeks in case of Ethernet links.

Costs for Open Telekom Cloud resources are only incurred after the services are established. Please consider this when planning your connection.
