I Need to Fill in the Order form for PLAS Connectivity, Where Do I Get VLAN IDs?
================================================================================

For all Ethernet-based options and PLAS Cloud Exchange, we will send you the S-Tag VLAN IDs for connecting our PLAS routers in Biere and Magdeburg if you open a ticket in the service desk console. We will reserve IDs.

If you have a PLAS option that does not need an S-Tag VLAN ID from our side but a full port, we will provide you with a port IP address. This also requires you to open a ticket. The port address will be reserved for 3 months before the reservation is canceled.
