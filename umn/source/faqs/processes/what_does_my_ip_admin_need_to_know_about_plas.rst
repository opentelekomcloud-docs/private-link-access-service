What Does my IP Admin Need to Know About PLAS?
==============================================

Your admin needs to know about your intention to connect your network to Open Telekom Cloud, even if it is managed by T-Systems or Deutsche Telekom. You might need their commitment and they need to check whether the existing access bandwidth of the entire network is sufficient for more traffic. In addition, security and access parameters in your LAN need to be checked by your admin.
