What Is VPC Endpoint?
=====================

VPC Endpoint offers more functionalities than VPC peering.

First, Open Telekom Cloud itself creates VPC endpoint services, which work like shared public instances that can be accessed from a VPC without using public IP addresses. These services include the OBS and the DNS service.

When building your own architecture, the option to connect any IP address service inside your VPC, other VPCs or tenants is very important. You can build complex network topologies including administration and security services.

VPC Endpoint is not embedded in PLAS, but helps you handle traffic between Direct Connect, edge and other instances. For more detailed information, please see the VPC Endpoint service description.
