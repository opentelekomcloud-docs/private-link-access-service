What Is Direct Connect?
=======================

Direct Connect is used to establish a connection from a virtual router in your VPC to a virtual gateway at the edge of Open Telekom Cloud. This gateway is connected to the PLAS (Private Link Access Service), which is responsible for the connection to an external network. In summary, Direct Connect and PLAS enable a private connection from your data center to your Open Telekom Cloud VPC. Direct Connect can access only one VPC, but you can use VPC peering or VPC Endpoint to route traffic to other VPCs.

For more detailed information, please see the Direct Connect endpoint service description.
