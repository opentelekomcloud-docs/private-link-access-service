What Is VPC Peering?
====================

VPC Peering is an internal Open Telekom Cloud network function and not embedded in PLAS. It is used if you need to access more than one VPC of your tenant (account). All traffic will be routed to your virtual gateway in the VPC where you create the Direct Connect. Then you can peer multiple other VPCs to route traffic to them. Routing might depend on VLAN structures used to transport data over the network. You can use security groups and/or firewalls to separate your architectures.

For more detailed information, please see the VPC Peering service description.
