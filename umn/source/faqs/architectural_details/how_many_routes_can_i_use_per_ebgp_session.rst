How Many Routes Can I Use per eBGP Session?
===========================================

You can advertise up to 100 routes per session. If you advertise more, the port will be set inactive. This will protect the cloud and you against route flooding. Try to aggregate routes. If you still need more routes, please contact the service desk.
