Can I Use Load Balancing on PLAS?
=================================

PLAS supports redundant links in an active/passive mode. This means that you can only use one active link. In a more sophisticated configuration, you can use two Direct Connects with PLAS in two different VPCs and set up an address scheme for load balancing. It is better to use load balancing after the network edge in front of your servers.
