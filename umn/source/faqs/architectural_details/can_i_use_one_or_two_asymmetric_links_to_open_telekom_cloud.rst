Can I Use One or Two Asymmetric Links to Open Telekom Cloud?
============================================================

We generally require two redundant links, since this is necessary for the active/passive architecture. It is not recommended to use only one link or two different bandwidths. In addition, the internet connectivity should not be used for backup.

If you are aware of the consequences a non-redundant architecture might involve and you do not need an SLA, please ask us to learn more about alternative options.
