Can I Connect Two Different Locations for the Two Required Links?
=================================================================

You can route the two links to one location or distribute traffic over two locations. PLAS only sees two different paths controlled by the eBGP protocol. Please note that in the second case, you still have an active and a passive link. You need a backup concept on layer 3 managed by yourself via your own data center backbone.
