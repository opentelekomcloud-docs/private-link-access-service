Does the External Network Bandwidth Have to Be Identical to the Direct Connect and PLAS Bandwidth?
==================================================================================================

There is a difference between the chosen bandwidth of the external network link and the Open Telekom Cloud bandwidth.

Usually, they should be the same, but for some reasons they could be different - resulting in underbooking or overbooking. While overbooking might be a waste of money, underbooking can be much more critical due to dropped packets.

As a general rule, Open Telekom Cloud does not check the "logic" between these bookings.
