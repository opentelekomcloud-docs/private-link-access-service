What Is PLAS?
=============

PLAS is the abbreviation of Private Link Access Service, one of the network services on Open Telekom Cloud. It allows customers to establish a dedicated and non-shared connection from their on-premises networks to the Open Telekom Cloud environment.

This option makes it possible to use the Open Telekom Cloud as a shared private cloud where only the administration interfaces (UI and API) are accessible via the internet. The virtual resources themselves (ECS, OBS, etc.) can be used via the private connection.

Private link means that Ethernet Connect or IP MPLS-based business VPNs are used to achieve SLA-based connectivity without being connected to the internet.

Using PLAS, customers benefit from the best results in speed, throughput, packet loss and security.
