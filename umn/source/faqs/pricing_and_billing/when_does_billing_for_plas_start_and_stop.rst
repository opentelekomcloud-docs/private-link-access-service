When Does Billing for PLAS Start and Stop?
==========================================

Billing starts as soon as you deploy the ports via the portal. Please note that we are not able to see when you start using the ports and how you use them. If you expect that your network provider will need a much longer time to prepare your connectivity to PLAS, please consult them before starting PLAS.

The billing for PLAS and Direct Connect is stopped immediately when you delete the Direct Connect and PLAS instances in the portal. Note that in this case as well, this is not synchronized with the contracts of your network provider. You need to synchronize that.
