What Are the Pricing Elements for a Private Connection via PLAS?
================================================================

Remember that any costs for the network part ending at the PLAS port in the Open Telekom Cloud data center will be charged by the network provider. Additional costs may be incurred for services provided by the cloud exchange provider.

For PLAS and Direct Connect, you have to pay for

-  Direct Connect installation (one-off fee)
-  Direct Connect port (per hour)
-  Direct Connect bandwidth (per hour)
-  PLAS port installation (one-off fee)
-  PLAS port size (per hour)
-  PLAS bandwidth (per hour)

It depends on the current pricing scheme whether a specific item is billed separately or included in other items, or whether it is not billed due to redundant usage etc.

The pricing calculator of Open Telekom Cloud is the easiest way to obtain an overview of costs. You can find an explanation on how to perform the calculation in the section of the price calculator.

There is no difference between pricing of the different PLAS options even when you need to choose it technically.

When comparing these prices to those of our competitors, please note that these are all flat-rate prices. No additional costs will be incurred for moving data to and from the system. This is the only model that enables you to calculate and predict the actual costs.
