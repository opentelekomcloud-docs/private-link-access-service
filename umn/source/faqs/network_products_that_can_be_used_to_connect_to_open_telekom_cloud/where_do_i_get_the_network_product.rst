Where Do I Get the Network Product?
===================================

PLAS is not compatible with all network providers. We are currently working on some options exclusively with Deutsche Telekom. You need to get in contact with Deutsche Telekom Sales and order products with Open Telekom Cloud access options. This may require a dedicated contract. Alternatively, you can also incorporate this option in your existing contract with Deutsche Telekom. You will find a list of products in this section.

If you want to get access with another provider, you will need to book the PLAS Cloud Exchange option, which is released with Equinix Europe for their Equinix Cloud Exchange product.

For any other configurations using a third-party network provider, please get in contact with us prior to any further activities.
