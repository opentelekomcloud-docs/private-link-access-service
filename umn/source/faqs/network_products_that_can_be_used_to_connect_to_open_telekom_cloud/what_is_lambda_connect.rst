What Is Lambda Connect?
=======================

Lambda Connect is a transparent DWDM service based on the Telekom Global Network (TGN). TGN has a global coverage and Deutsche Telekom provides access to Open Telekom Cloud using two different POPs in Biere and Magdeburg. The typical bandwidth to Open Telekom Cloud includes dedicated 10G links. In some cases, Lambda Connect may be a potential alternative to Ethernet Connect 10G.

For more information about Lambda Connect, see the Network section on the Deutsche Telekom website for "`Gesch√§ftskunden <https://geschaeftskunden.telekom.de/vernetzung-digitalisierung/vernetzung/standortvernetzung>`__."
