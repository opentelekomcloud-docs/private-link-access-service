What Is Ethernet Connect?
=========================

All information on Ethernet Connect can be found on the Deutsche Telekom website for "`Gesch√§ftskunden <https://geschaeftskunden.telekom.de/vernetzung-digitalisierung/vernetzung/standortvernetzung>`__" or you can ask your Deutsche Telekom sales representative.

Please note the special product for Open Telekom Cloud access. You cannot order Ethernet Connect as a standard product and there is no option for you to order an Ethernet Connect 2.0 product.

However, if you need a bandwidth of 10 Gbit/s, we can realize this as a project. You need to establish two 10G links to the data centers in Biere and Magdeburg. We only accept a redundant pair of links.

In this case, you can implement Ethernet Connect as well as Ethernet Connect 2.0 or Lambda Connect (as a single endpoint in a VPN).
