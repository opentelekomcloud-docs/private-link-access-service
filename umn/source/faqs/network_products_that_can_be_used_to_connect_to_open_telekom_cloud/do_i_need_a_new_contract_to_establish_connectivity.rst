Do I Need a New Contract to Establish Connectivity?
===================================================

The network product is NOT part of your Open Telekom Cloud contract. You need conclude an independent contract with Deutsche Telekom, a third-party network provider or a cloud connectivity broker.

Please contact your sales manager for further information on the various options.
