What Is Secure Cloud Connect?
=============================

Secure Cloud Connect is a product of Deutsche Telekom and is sold to end customers and other network providers. It is based on the Telekom Global Network (TGN) and offers broad global coverage.

Secure Cloud Connect uses MEF standards on top of the platform to establish virtual connections between locations, with a focus on public cloud connectivity.

It offers a multi-cloud environment, meaning that as soon as you connect your own locations, you can access 50+ clouds in different locations around the world.

Deployment of virtual links in addition to the established local loops is very flexible and changes are implemented within a few days.

Secure Cloud Connect is directly connected to Open Telekom Cloud and offers maximum redundancy.

It offers a capacity of up to 1G via virtual link. The platform itself can be connected via 1G or 10G ports.

For more information on Secure Cloud Connect, see the Network section on the Deutsche Telekom website for "`Gesch√§ftskunden <https://globalcarrier.telekom.com/business-areas/access-transport/ethernet/secure-cloud-connect>`__".
