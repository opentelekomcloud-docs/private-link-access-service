What Is Equinix Cloud Exchange?
===============================

Equinix is a company offering services including colocation, telehouse and internet exchange.

Equinix Cloud Exchange is a product to connect public clouds. Currently, it can be used to connect more than 50 clouds depending on the region.

Customers can connect to ports from their colocation space or via wide area network in order to access the ECX portal. On the portal, they can choose all clouds and locations available on the marketplace.

Customers need a contract with Equinix. In some cases, their network provider might offer this as a managed service. Open Telekom Cloud is not able to manage this for you.

More information can be found on the `Equinix website <https://www.equinix.de/interconnection-services/cloud-exchange-fabric/>`__ under the product name Equinix Cloud Exchange.
