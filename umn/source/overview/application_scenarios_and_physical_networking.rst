Application Scenarios and Physical Networking
=============================================

Application Scenarios
---------------------

PLAS enables public cloud platform users to establish exclusive connections from their on-premise networks data centers, or collocation environments to VPCs on the public cloud platform. These connections outperform Internet connections in stability and security.

PLAS can connect:

-  A Layer 2 private network (EC) to a VPC on the OTC
-  A Layer 3 private network (IP VPN) to a VPC on the OTC

Physical Networking
-------------------

The following figure shows the physical network of PLAS.
